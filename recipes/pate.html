        <p> This silky-smooth pâté is inexpensive and simple to make. The chicken livers are briefly simmered in water with aromatics before they're blended with butter in a food processor. If you have the opportunity to choose, shop for paler chicken livers; they tend to have a mellower, richer flavor than deep-red ones.

            <strong>1/2 pound</strong> chicken livers, well-trimmed<br>

            <strong>1/4 teaspoon</strong> thyme leaves<br>
            Kosher salt<br>
            <strong>1/2 cup</strong> water<br>
            <strong>1 1/2 sticks</strong> unsalted butter, at room temperature<br>
            <strong>2 teaspoons</strong> Cognac or Scotch whisky<br>

            <h3>Directions</h3>
            <br>
            <h4>Step 1</h4>
            <p>In a medium saucepan, combine the chicken livers, onion, garlic, bay leaf, thyme and 1/2 teaspoon of salt. Add the water and bring to a simmer. Cover, reduce the heat to low and cook, stirring occasionally, until the livers are barely pink inside, about 3 minutes. Remove from the heat and let stand, covered, for 5 minutes.
            </p>
            <h4>Step 2</h4>
            <p>Discard the bay leaf. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the livers, onion and garlic to a food processor; process until coarsely pureed. With the machine on, add the butter, 2 tablespoons at a time, until incorporated. Add the Cognac, season with salt and pepper and process until completely smooth. Scrape the pâté into 2 or 3 large ramekins. Press a piece of plastic wrap directly onto the surface of the pâté and refrigerate until firm. Serve chilled.
            </p>

            <h3>Tip: Make Ahead</h3>
            <p>The pâté can be covered with a thin layer of melted butter, then wrapped in plastic and refrigerated for up to 1 week or frozen for up to 2 months.</p>
